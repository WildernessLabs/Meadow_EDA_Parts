## 3D Models

There are 3D models of our boards located in the 3D model folder:

- `MeadowF7.skp` is the 3D model of the board made in SketchUp by the contribution of Nicol√≤ Carandini to produce the WRL format used for KiCad.

- `MeadowF7Micro_REVD.step` is the 3D model of the board saved in STEP format. It's not complete but it is a good starting point for creating more refined models.
